# Mini-Projects

Welcome to my Mini-Projects folder! 

Here, I will be working on a series of mini-projects to enhance and refine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

These projects will cover a wide range of topics, from simple static web pages to more complex dynamic web applications. By tackling these mini-projects, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving abilities, deepen my understanding of web development concepts, and build a robust portfolio of work. 

Thank you for stopping by and please feel free to explore my projects and leave any feedback you may have!
